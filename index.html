      Warren Edward Buffett is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is currently the chairman
      and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. As a result of his immense investment success, Buffett is one of the best-known
      fundamental investors in the world. As of June 2023, he possessed a net worth of $117 billion making him the
      fifth-richest person in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. The son of congressman and businessman Howard Buffett, he developed an
      interest in business and investing during his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of
      Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to
      graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value
      investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon after began various
      investment business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his
      investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to
      create a diversified holding company, and later as the company's chairman and majority shareholder in 1970. In
      1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.

    <h3>
      Early Life
    </h3>
    <p>
      Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only son of Leila (née Stahl)
      and Congressman Howard Buffett. He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was
      elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington,
      D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then
      Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; a future stockbroker".
      After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett
      wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.

    <h3>
      Personal Life
    </h3>
    <p>
      In 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he
      bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was
      unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life, and led to
      their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of
      the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was
      auctioned for charity.
